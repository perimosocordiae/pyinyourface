# pyinyourface
An Active Shape Model for Faces: Trainer and Aligner

Developed for the Computer Vision class at Washington University in St. Louis, Spring 2010.

# Running

This project requires:
  * [Python 2.6+](http://www.python.org/)
  * [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
  * [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML)
  * [OpenCV 2.x](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/)

Once the necessary prerequisites are installed and on your PYTHONPATH,
you should be able to run 'align' or 'train' successfully with your Python interpreter.

# Disclaimer

I've only tested this code on 64-bit Linux systems, but there's no reason why it shouldn't work on other platforms.
If you run into problems, leave a comment or send me an email.
